# Strategic Market Intelligence Web Scraping Application

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of an application that automatically scrapes the internet to collect strategic business intelligence on top companies within a selected industry or market segment. The goal is to transform scattered, unstructured online information into structured, comparable insights that support competitive analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Problem Statement

Strategic and market analysis often requires manually gathering data from multiple online sources, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. There is a need for an automated solution that can systematically collect, organize, and visualize key company-level metrics across an industry.

## Solution

I developed a Python-based web scraping application that aggregates strategic company data from publicly available online sources. The application extracts relevant metrics, cleans and structures the data, and enables comparative analysis through plotting and visualization.

## Key Features

* Automated web scraping of company-level strategic data
* Collection of key metrics such as:

  * Market capitalization
  * Funding and investment history
  * Number of years in business
  * Executive leadership information
  * Stock price and market performance (where applicable)
* Data cleaning and structuring for analysis
* Comparative plotting and visualization of company metrics

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Core development, data extraction, data processing, and visualization
* **Claude (AI Assistant)** – Used to assist with code generation, logic design, debugging, and optimization
* **VS Code** – Development environment and debugging

## Methodology

1. Defined data requirements and target metrics for strategic company analysis
2. Used Claude as an AI coding assistant to generate and refine Python scraping logic
3. Implemented and customized generated code to scrape relevant public data sources
4. Cleaned, validated, and normalized scraped data for consistency and accuracy
5. Structured datasets to enable comparison across multiple companies
6. Visualized insights using plots to highlight trends and competitive positioning

## Demo Walkthrough (Based on Project Video)

The demo video showcases the end-to-end workflow of the application. The process begins with selecting a target industry and defining company-level metrics for analysis. The application then executes Python-based web scraping scripts to collect publicly available data across multiple sources. Scraped data is processed and structured into tabular form, followed by visualization through comparative plots that highlight differences in market capitalization, company maturity, leadership structure, and market performance.

The video demonstrates how automated data collection significantly reduces manual research effort and enables faster strategic insights through visual comparison.

## Outcomes & Impact

* Reduced manual research time by automating data collection across multiple sources
* Enabled faster and more objective comparison of companies within an industry
* Created a reusable framework for market intelligence and competitive analysis

## Future Enhancements

* Integration of APIs for real-time financial and stock market data
* Expansion to support multiple industries and geographies
* Dashboard-based visualization for interactive analysis
* Enhanced error handling and compliance-focused scraping controls
